# A collection of datasets with error codes

Datasets in this collection gather information about errors that are typically
observed in Continuous Integration builds. By looking up the error by its code
one can get additional information such as the program, mnemonic, severity and
even a link to the official documentation if it is available.

All the datasets are store as tab-separated (*.tsv) files.
